#1) Data Survey
   ## Do a summary of the data. Any column with number of high NA's is excluded.
   ## Time related itmes, such "raw_timestamp_part_2", seem not correlate to 
   ## classe column.So they are excluded from modeling.
   ## There are 52 columns with full numeric data and there are few column 
   ## correlated each other, but most of them don't have high correlation each 
   ## other or any single column has signficant correlation with classe column.
#2) Feature Creation 
   ## Since I don't have enough time to get domain knowledge, and the sample 
   ## size is large enough,  I decided to use all 52 numberic columns to predict  
   ## classe
#3) Algorithm
   ## randomForest is a popular choice for classification modeling
   ## Training data set will divided into two portion. 70% of data are used for 
   ## model traing, and 30% of data are used for model validation.
   ## Estimate error: 5 fold Cross validation indicates 36 variables should be 
   ## enough. 
   ## Accuracy should be greater than 98%.
#4) Code and results

    library(caret)
    library(randomForest)
    
    mydata<-read.csv("pml-training.csv")
    mydata2<-mydata[,grep("^gyro|^magnet|^accel|^roll|^pitch|^yaw|^total|classe"   
    ,colnames(mydata))]

    featurePlot(x=mydata2[,48:52],y=mydata$classe,plot="box")
    
    cor(mydata2[,48:52])
    
    trainIndex <- createDataPartition(mydata2$classe, p = 0.70,list=FALSE)
    training<-mydata2[trainIndex,]
    testing<-mydata2[-trainIndex,]
    
    ##cross validation
    tst <- rfcv(trainx = training[,-53], trainy = training[,53], cv.fold=5,scale = "log", step=0.7) 
    with(tst, plot(n.var, error.cv, log="x", type="o", lwd=2))
    tst$error.cv

  ##testing
  confusionMatrix(testing$classe,predict(fit6,testing))
  ##20 Cases Testing (submitted to website, 100% right)
    mydata3<-read.csv("pml-testing.csv")
    predictions<-predict(fit6,mydata3[,grep("^gyro|^magnet|^accel|^roll|^pitch|^yaw|^total",colnames(mydata3))])
    predictions
```
   

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
